Devlog #0 — Rain, Doubt, and Beginning Again

For a month, I built a roguelike card game.

For another month, I did nothing.

Somewhere between balancing mechanics and sketching systems, a quiet question started echoing:

Is this what I really want to make?

Not “can I finish it?”
Not “is this technically impressive?”

But — does it carry anything of me?

I have always believed that narrative is not plot.

It is a transfer of feeling.

A moment.

Like the first time I read
“晴川历历汉阳树.”

The sunlight in that line burns.
It is bright enough to hurt the eyes.
And yet, it is cold.

The world is sharp, clear — almost painfully so.
And somehow, you already know that something sad will follow.

Or spring rain.

Not violent.
Not dramatic.

Just steady.

The kind that falls softly enough that you want to lower your umbrella for a second.
The kind that taps against fabric in a rhythm too perfect to ignore.
The kind that never quite soaks you, never quite dirties your shoes.

Morning gray.
Midday clouds edged by hidden light.
Evening dissolving into ultramarine.

These moments feel overwhelming.

And I don’t know how to explain them.

The roguelike began to feel heavy.

Too many systems.
Too many dependencies.
Too many assets I didn’t yet have.

The structure grew.

But the feeling disappeared.

So I stopped.

And when I returned, I decided to change direction.

Not away from games.

Never away from games.

But toward something smaller.

I want to build a game led by rain.

Rain will not be decoration.

Rain will be the rule.

Its intensity will rise and fall in rhythm.
Paths will open only in heavy rain.
Mechanisms will respond only in light rain.
Water will gather, then recede.

At first, the player will wait.

Then, they will anticipate.

Eventually, they will move with the rain.

If that happens — if the player begins to feel the rhythm rather than just observe it — then maybe I have done something right.

This project is not about scale.

It is about restraint.

One mechanic.
One atmosphere.
One thread of emotion.

I am not trying to build something grand.

I am trying to learn how to make something honest.

This is the real beginning.
